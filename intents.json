    "responses": ["The Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering is the most common type of hierarchical clustering used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity. It‟s also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting). It's a “bottom-up” approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.  We assign each point to an individual cluster in this technique. Suppose there are 4 data points. We will assign each of these points to a cluster and hence will have 4 clusters in the beginning:  Then, at each iteration, we merge the closest pair of clusters and repeat this step until only a single cluster is left:  We are merging (or adding) the clusters at each step, right? Hence, this type of clustering is also known as additive hierarchical clustering."]

Instead of starting with n clusters (in case of n observations), we start with a single cluster and assign all the points to that cluster.  So, it doesn‟t matter if we have 10 or 1000 data points. All these points will belong to the same cluster at the beginning  Now, at each iteration, we split the farthest point in the cluster and repeat this process until each cluster only contains a single point  We are splitting (or dividing) the clusters at each step, hence the name divisive hierarchical clustering."]

Later we then update the proximity matrix: Here, the smallest distance is 3 and hence we will merge point 1 and 2 Step 3: repeat step 2 until only a single cluster is left. Creating a Proximity Matrix First, we will create a proximity matrix which will tell us the distance between each of these points. Since we are calculating the distance of each point from each of the other points, we will get a square matrix of shape n X n (where n is the number of observations). Let‟s make the 5 x 5 proximity matrix for our example: Formulae to calculate distance (Manhattan) √((x2-x1)^2+ ((y2-y1)^2)"]
